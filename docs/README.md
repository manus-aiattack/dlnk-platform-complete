## Features

- **One-Click Attack:** Fully automated attack orchestration from reconnaissance to exploitation.

- **AI-Powered Decision Making:** An advanced AI engine that plans attack strategies, predicts success rates, and adapts to target defenses.

- **Zero-Day Hunter System:** Proactively hunts for unknown vulnerabilities using fuzzing, symbolic execution, and taint analysis.

- **Self-Healing & Self-Learning:** The system automatically recovers from errors and learns from every attack to improve its effectiveness over time.

- **Comprehensive Reporting:** Generates detailed reports on vulnerabilities, attack paths, and system performance.

- **Extensible Agent-Based Architecture:** Easily extendable with new agents for different attack techniques and technologies.

## System Architecture

The platform is built on a modular, microservice-inspired architecture:

- **Frontend:** A React-based web interface for user interaction, real-time monitoring, and reporting.

- **API Gateway:** A FastAPI-based gateway that provides a unified interface to all backend services.

- **One-Click Orchestrator:** The core component that manages the entire attack lifecycle.

- **AI System:** The brain of the platform, responsible for intelligent decision-making and learning.

- **Zero-Day Hunter:** A dedicated system for discovering novel vulnerabilities.

- **Supporting Services:** A suite of services for performance monitoring, security auditing, and self-healing.
