## How to Use

### CLI Usage

```bash
# Login
dlnk auth login --api-key YOUR_API_KEY

# Start attack
dlnk attack start https://example.com --type full_auto --follow

# List attacks
dlnk attack list

# Show attack details
dlnk attack show <attack_id>

# Generate report
dlnk report generate <attack_id> --format html

# System status
dlnk system status
```

### Configuration

CLI configuration is stored at `~/.dlnk/config.yaml`:

```yaml
api:
  url: http://localhost:8000
  key: DLNK-xxxxx
  timeout: 30

user:
  username: admin
  role: admin

preferences:
  theme: dark
  output_format: table
  verbose: false
  color: true

notifications:
  enabled: true
  channels:
    - terminal
```
