# Redis and PostgreSQL Integration Report

This report summarizes the integration of Redis and PostgreSQL into the Apex Predator AI system. This integration provides a robust backend for data persistence, caching, and session management, laying the groundwork for more advanced features.

## Phase 1: Database Schema and Redis Setup

**Objective:** Establish the core database schema and configure Redis for caching.

**Work Completed:**
- Created a `database` directory to house all database-related scripts.
- Defined the PostgreSQL schema in `database/schema.sql` for `users`, `api_keys`, `attack_logs`, and `workflow_states` tables.
- Implemented `database/init_db.py` to automatically initialize the database and create an admin user.
- Configured a Redis connection manager in `database/redis_config.py` with connection pooling and basic cache functions (`set`, `get`).
- Updated `requirements.txt` with necessary libraries: `asyncpg`, `redis`, `python-dotenv`.

**Key Files:**
- `database/schema.sql`
- `database/init_db.py`
- `database/redis_config.py`

## Phase 2: License and API Key Management

**Objective:** Implement a secure system for managing API keys.

**Work Completed:**
- Created an `api/license` directory.
- Implemented `api/license/license_manager.py` to handle:
    - Secure generation of API keys.
    - Validation of keys against the database.
    - Revocation of keys.
    - Expiration checks.
- Implemented `api/license/admin_notifications.py` to provide a framework for notifying administrators of key-related events (e.g., expiration, revocation).

**Key Files:**
- `api/license/license_manager.py`
- `api/license/admin_notifications.py`

## Phase 3: Attack Logging and Session Management

**Objective:** Develop a comprehensive system for logging attack workflows and managing user sessions.

**Work Completed:**
- Implemented `core/attack_logger.py` to:
    - Log the start, phases, and completion of attacks to the PostgreSQL database.
    - Save and load the complete state of an attack workflow, allowing for resumable attacks.
    - Cache the real-time status of attacks in Redis for quick lookups.
- Implemented `core/session_manager.py` to manage user sessions using Redis, providing functions to create, validate, and terminate sessions.

**Key Files:**
- `core/attack_logger.py`
- `core.session_manager.py`

## Phase 4: Testing and Workflow Integration

**Objective:** Ensure the new components work correctly and integrate them into the main attack workflow.

**Work Completed:**
- Created unit tests for the new modules:
    - `tests/test_license_management.py`
    - `tests/test_attack_logging.py`
- Created an integration test in `tests/test_integration.py` to verify that the components work together as expected.
- Added `asynctest` to `requirements.txt` for testing asynchronous code.
- Refactored `core/attack_workflow.py` to use the new `attack_logger` for all state management and logging, removing the old file-based persistence.

**Key Files:**
- `tests/test_license_management.py`
- `tests/test_attack_logging.py`
- `tests/test_integration.py`
- `core/attack_workflow.py` (modified)

## How to Use

1.  **Environment Setup:**
    - Ensure your `.env` file is configured with the correct `DATABASE_URL` and `REDIS_URL`.

2.  **Initialize the Database:**
    - Run the initialization script from the project root:
      ```bash
      python -m database.init_db
      ```
    - This will create all necessary tables and provide you with an initial admin password. **Save this password securely.**

3.  **Run the Application:**
    - The application will now use PostgreSQL for storing attack data and Redis for caching and sessions.

4.  **API Key Management (Example):**
    - You can now programmatically generate and manage API keys using the functions in `api.license.license_manager`.

## Conclusion

This integration marks a significant milestone for the project, moving it from a transient, file-based system to a scalable and persistent platform. All attack data is now centrally logged, workflows can be resumed, and user access can be securely managed. The new testing framework ensures the reliability of these critical components.
